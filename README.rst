Python interface for waterfurnace and geostar geothermal systems.

This provides basic sensor readings for waterfurnace geothermal systems by
using the websocket interface that exists for the symphony website. This is not
a documented or stable interface, so don't use this for critical
systems. However, it is useful to record historical usage of your waterfurnace
system.

Usage
=====

.. code-block:: python

   from waterfurnace.waterfurnace import WaterFurnace
   wf = WaterFurnace(user, pass)
   wf.login()
   data = wf.read()

.. code-block:: python

   from waterfurnace.waterfurnace import GeoStar
   gs = GeoStar(user, pass)
   gs.login()
   data = gs.read()

The waterfurnace symphony service websocket monitors it's usage, so you need to
do a data reading at least every 30 seconds otherwise the websocket is closed
on the server side for resource constraints. The symphony website does a poll
on the websocket every 5 seconds.

Known Issues / limitations
==========================

* The python websocket code goes into a blocked state after long periods of
  usage (always takes days to get to this state). I've yet to discover
  why. Help welcome.
* If you have multiple waterfurnace units on one account, this will only use
  the first.
